/**
 * Sensitivity computation API
 *
 * Sensitivity computation is a concrete calculation of impact factors from some network variables modification
 * to some network function values.
 *
 * This can be assimilated to a partial derivative computation, which is effectively an efficient
 * implementation for sensitivity computation.
