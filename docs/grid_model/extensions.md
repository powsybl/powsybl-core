(grid-model-extensions)=
# Grid model extensions

The grid model contains enough data to basically describe supported components and run power flow computations, but it may not be sufficient for more complex studies.
The extensions are a way to add additional structured data to an equipment to extend its features.
The extensions can be attached to any objects of a network or to the network itself.

Some extensions are mono-variant meaning the data are identical for all the variants of the network. However, some of them are multi-variants to allow a different value for each variant of the network. It's typically the case for the [LoadDetail](#load-detail) extension that give the distribution of the constant part and the thermo-sensitive part of a consumption. 

Note that some extensions provided by PowSyBl aren't supported in the [persistent implementation of IIDM](../../developer/repositories/powsybl-network-store-server.md).

Every extension is considered as serializable unless explicitly specified as non-serializable in XML-IIDM.

(active-power-control-extension)=
## Active power control
This extension is used to configure the participation factor of the generator, typically in the case of a load flow computation with distributed slack enabled (with [balance type](../simulation/loadflow/configuration.md#generic-parameters) on generator). This extension is attached to a [generator](network_subnetwork.md#generator) or a [battery](network_subnetwork.md#battery).

| droop                | double  | None (repartition key) | no       | -             | The participation factor equals Pmax / droop |
| participation factor | double  | None (repartition key) | no       | -             | Defines the participation factor explicitly  |

Here is how to add an active power control extension to a generator:
```java
generator.newExtension(ActivePowerControlAdder.class)
    .withParticipate(true)
    .withDroop(4)
    .withParticipationFactor(1.5)
    .add();
```

The participation status and the participation factor are multi-variants: they can vary from one variant to another.

This extension is provided by the `com.powsybl:powsybl-iidm-extensions` module.

(busbar-section-position-extension)=
## Busbar section position

This extension gives positions information about a busbar section. The `busbarIndex` gives the position of the busbar section relatively to other busbars. The `sectionIndex` gives the position of the busbar section within the corresponding busbar. Note that a busbar is a set of busbar sections. Hence, the sections of a same busbar should have the same busbar index. The busbar indices induce an order of busbars within the voltage level, which usually reflects the busbars physical relative positions. Similarly, the section indices induce an order of sections of a same busbar, which usually reflects their physical relative position.

```java
generator.newExtension(CoordinatedReactiveControlAdder.class)
    .withQPercent(40)
    .add();
```

Please note that the sum of the $qPercent$ values of the generators coordinating a same point of the network must be 100.

    .add();
```

(load-asymmetrical-extension)=
## Load asymmetrical

A balanced load is described by its active power setpoint $P0$ and its reactive power setpoint $Q0$.
This extension is used to describe the power asymmetry for each ABC phase. In the three-phase representation, the complex power injected at a bus $i$ is constant for each phase and represented by three complex values:

$$
\begin{align}
S_{Ai_{Load}}=S_{A}=P_{A}+j.Q_{A} \\
S_{Bi_{Load}}=S_{B}=P_{B}+j.Q_{B} \\
S_{Ci_{Load}}=S_{C}=P_{C}+j.Q_{C} \\
\end{align}
$$

But for a balanced load flow, the constant power load $P$ and $Q$ refer to the positive sequence load. Given that, in balanced conditions, the load for zero and negative sequences should always be zero. However, in real life, power loads are better defined in the ABC three phases representation. The load extension addresses this issue keeping the default behavior for balanced conditions.

<u>Balanced load flow conditions:</u>

In balanced conditions given the load at bus:

$$ S_{1i_{Load}}=P_{Load}+j.Q_{Load} $$

We must verify:  

$$ 0 = -S_{1i_{Load}} +\sum_{j=\delta(i)}^{} S_{1ij} $$

<u>Unbalanced load flow conditions:</u>

We must take into account that many loads are still balanced and information related to balanced loads is sufficient. The extension proposes a delta approach where unbalances are expressed in the extension. Supposing that:

$$
\begin{align}
\Delta P_{Ai_{Load}}, \Delta Q_{Ai_{Load}},
\Delta P_{Bi_{Load}}, \Delta Q_{Bi_{Load}},
\Delta P_{Ci_{Load}}, \Delta Q_{Ci_{Load}}
\end{align}
$$

are provided in input through the extension. The three-phase power values used as inputs of an unbalanced load flow calculation are:

$$
\begin{align}
S_{Ai_{Load}}=(P_{Load}+\Delta P_{Ai_{Load}})+j.(Q_{Load}+\Delta Q_{Ai_{Load}}) \\
S_{Bi_{Load}}=(P_{Load}+\Delta P_{Bi_{Load}})+j.(Q_{Load}+\Delta Q_{Bi_{Load}}) \\
S_{Ci_{Load}}=(P_{Load}+\Delta P_{Ci_{Load}})+j.(Q_{Load}+\Delta Q_{Ci_{Load}}) \\
\end{align}
$$

As a consequence, if no extension provided for the load, the unbalanced load flow will use in input:

$$
\begin{align}
S_{Ai_{Load}}=P_{Load}+j.Q_{Load} \\
S_{Bi_{Load}}=P_{Load}+j.Q_{Load} \\
S_{Ci_{Load}}=P_{Load}+j.Q_{Load} \\
\end{align}
$$

| --------- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- |

        .withDeltaPa(-1)
        .withDeltaQa(1)
        .withDeltaPb(-2)

| fixedReactivePower    | double | MVar | yes      | -             | The part of the reactive power setpoint that is considered constant |

    .withFixedActivePower(20)
    .withVariableReactivePower(5)

(operating-status-extension)=
## Operating status

This is an extension of `Identifiable`, but it is restricted to some identifiable types: busbar sections, all branches,
three-winding transformers, HVDC line and a dangling line. The status could be:
- `IN_OPERATION`: equipment in service.
- `PLANNED_OUTAGE`: outage due to an unscheduled putting out of service of the equipment.
- `FORCED_OUTAGE`: outage due to a programmed taking out of service of the equipment.

(reference-priority-extension)=
## Reference Priority

This extension is attached to a Generator, or a BusBarSection or a Load and is used to define the angle reference bus of
a power flow calculation, i.e. which bus will be used with a zero voltage angle.
Use this extension before a computation to force the reference bus selection.
The support of this feature by Load Flow implementations may vary. For example, the [OpenLoadFlow](../simulation/powerflow/openlf.md) implementation
today supports Reference Priorities on generators only when this feature is activated.

The reference bus is defined through the terminal of the equipment and an integer specifying the reference priority.
0 means "do not use as reference", 1 is "highest priority", 2 "second priority", etc.

| Attribute | Type       | Unit | Required | Default value | Description            |
|-----------|------------|------|----------|---------------|------------------------|

(slack-terminal-extension)=
## Slack terminal

This extension is attached to a [voltage level](network_subnetwork.md#voltage-level) and is used to define the slack bus
of a power flow calculation i.e. which bus will be used to balance the active and reactive power in load flow analysis.
Use this extension before a computation to force the slack bus selection. You should enable default load flow parameter
[`isReadSlackBus`](../simulation/loadflow/configuration.md#generic-parameters). Use this extension after a computation to attach
to the network the slack bus that has been selected by the load flow engine (one by connected component). You should enable
default load flow parameter [`isWriteSlackBus`](../simulation/loadflow/configuration.md#generic-parameters).

The slack bus is defined through the terminal of a connectable that belongs to the bus. It is totally allowed to define a disconnected terminal as slack as the connectable could be reconnected during a grid study.
