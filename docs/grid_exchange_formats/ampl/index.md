The [AMPL](https://ampl.com/) (**A** **M**athematical **P**rogramming **L**anguage) format is an algebraic modeling language to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing (i.e. large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems).

IIDM networks can be converted in flat text files easy to read in AMPL, each of which describing one type of the network equipment (batteries, generators, loads, branches, buses, etc.).
