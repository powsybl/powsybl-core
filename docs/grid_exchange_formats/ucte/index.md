The [**U**nion for the **C**o-ordination of **T**ransmission of **E**lectricity](https://www.ucte.org), created in 1951, coordinated the operation and development of the electricity transmission grid for the Continental European synchronously operated transmission grid, thus providing a reliable platform to all participants of the Internal Electricity Market and beyond.

In 1999, UCTE re-defined itself as an association of TSOs in the context of the Internal Energy Market. Building on its experience with recommendations, UCTE turned to make its technical standards. These standards became indispensable for the reliable international operation of the high voltage grids which are all working at one “heart beat”: the 50 Hz UCTE frequency related to the nominal balance between generation and the electricity demand of some 500 million people in one of the biggest electrical synchronous interconnections worldwide.

On 1 July 2009 UCTE was wound up. All operational tasks were transferred to ENTSO-E.
