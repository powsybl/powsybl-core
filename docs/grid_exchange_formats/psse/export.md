# Export

There are two main use-cases supported:
* Update.
* Full export.

The update option is only valid if the `psse.export.update` option is set to `true` and the case was previously imported using the same format. This option preserves the version of the initial case and the format if the case was imported using PSS速E version 35. The update creates a copy of the initial case and modifies it by updating the relevant values in each PSS速E data block.

The full export option creates a new PSS速E version 35 case from scratch, using only the information available in the PowSyBl model. By default, the case is exported in `raw` format, but the `rawx` format can be selected by setting the `psse.export.raw-format` option to `false`. The detailed connectivity is also exported, with each substation in the PowSyBl model corresponding to a substation in PSS速E.
A voltage level is exported as node-breaker when the topologyKind is `NODE_BREAKER`, there is at least one switch, and the number of buses within the voltage level is less than 999.

## Options
Parameters for the export can be defined in the configuration file in the [import-export-parameters-default-value](../../user/configuration/import-export-parameters-default-value.md#import-export-parameters-default-value) module.

**psse.export.update**  
The `psse.export.update` property is optional and defines whether the exporter should perform an update. The default value is `true`.

**psse.export.raw-format**  
The `psse.export.raw-format` property is optional and defines whether the exporter should use the `raw` format. The default value is `true`.
