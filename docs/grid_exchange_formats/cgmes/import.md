# Import

The CIM-CGMES importer reads and converts a CIM-CGMES model to the PowSyBl grid model. The import process is performed in two steps:
- Read input files into a triplestore
- Convert CIM-CGMES data retrieved by SPARQL requests from the created triplestore to PowSyBl grid model

The data in input CIM/XML files uses RDF (Resource Description Framework) syntax. In RDF, data is described making statements about resources using triplet expressions: (subject, predicate, object).
To describe the conversion from CGMES to PowSyBl, we first introduce some generic considerations about the level of detail of the model (node/breaker or bus/branch), the identity of the equipments and equipment containment in substations and voltage levels. After that, the conversion for every CGMES relevant class is explained. Consistency checks and validations performed during the conversion are mentioned in the corresponding sections.

(cgmes-import-level-of-detail)=
## Levels of detail: node/breaker and bus/branch

CGMES models defined at node/breaker level of detail will be mapped to PowSyBl node/breaker topology level. CGMES models defined at bus/branch level will be mapped to PowSyBl bus/breaker topology level.

For each equipment in the PowSyBl grid model, it is necessary to specify how it should be connected to the network.

If the model is specified at the bus/breaker level, a `Bus` must be specified for the equipment.

If the voltage level is built at node/breaker level, a `Node` must be specified when adding the equipment to PowSyBl. The conversion will create a different `Node` in PowSyBl for each equipment connection.

Using the `Node` or `Bus` information, PowSyBl creates a `Terminal` that will be used to manage the point of connection of the equipment to the network.

Some equipment, like switches, lines or transformers, have more than one point of connection to the Network.

In PowSyBl, a `Node` can have zero or one terminal. In CGMES, the `ConnectivityNode` objects may have more than one associated terminal. To be able to represent this in PowSyBl, the conversion process will automatically create internal connections between the PowSyBl nodes that represent equipment connections and the nodes created to map `ConnectivityNode` objects.

(cgmes-id-import)=
## Identity of model equipments

Almost all the equipments of the PowSyBl grid model require a unique identifier `Id` and may optionally have a human-readable `Name`. Whenever possible, these attributes will be directly copied from original CGMES attributes.

Terminals are used by CGMES and PowSyBl to define the points of connection of the equipment to the network. CGMES terminals have unique identifiers. PowSyBl does not allow terminals to have an associated identifier. Information about original CGMES terminal identifiers is stored in each PowSyBl object using aliases.

(cgmes-substation-voltage-level-import)=
## Equipment containers: substations and voltage levels

The PowSyBl grid model establishes the substation as a required container of voltage levels and transformers (two- and three-winding transformers and phase shifters). Voltage levels are the required container of the rest of the network equipment, except for the AC and DC transmission lines that establish connections between substations and are directly associated with the network model. All buses at the transformer ends should be kept in the same substation.

The CGMES model does not guarantee these hierarchical constraints, so the first step in the conversion process is to identify all the transformers with ends in different substations and all the breakers and switches with ends in different voltage levels. All the voltage levels connected by breakers or switches should be mapped to a single voltage level in the PowSyBl grid model. The first CGMES voltage level, in alphabetical order, will be the representative voltage level associated with the PowSyBl voltage level. The same criterion is used for substations, and the first CGMES substation will be the representative substation associated with the PowSyBl one. The joined voltage level and substation information is used in almost every step of the mapping between CGMES and PowSyBl models, and it is recorded in the `Context` conversion class, which keeps the data throughout the entire conversion process.

## Conversion from CGMES to PowSyBl grid model

The following sections describe in detail how each supported CGMES network object is converted to PowSyBl network model objects.

(cgmes-substation-import)=
### Substation

For each substation (considering only the representative substation if they are connected by transformers) in the CGMES model a new substation is created in the PowSyBl grid model with the following attributes created as such:
- `Country` It is obtained from the `regionName` property as a first option, from `subRegionName` as second option. Otherwise, is assigned to `null`.
- `GeographicalTags` It is obtained from the `SubRegion` property.

(cgmes-voltage-level-import)=
### VoltageLevel

As for substations, for each voltage level (considering only the representative voltage level if they are connected by switches) in the CGMES model, a new voltage level is created in the PowSyBl grid model with the following attributes created as such:
- `NominalV` It is copied from the `nominalVoltage` property of the CGMES voltage level.
- `TopologyKind` It will be `NODE_BREAKER` or `BUS_BREAKER` depending on the level of detail of the CGMES grid model.
- `LowVoltageLimit` It is copied from the `lowVoltageLimit` property.
- `HighVoltageLimit` It is copied from the `highVoltageLimit` property.

(cgmes-connectivity-node-import)=
### ConnectivityNode

If the CGMES model is a node/breaker model then `ConnectivityNode` objects are present in the CGMES input files, and for each of them a new `Node` is created in the corresponding PowSyBl voltage level. A `Node` in the PowSyBl model is an integer identifier that is unique by voltage level.

If the import option `iidm.import.cgmes.create-busbar-section-for-every-connectivity-node` is `true` an additional busbar section is also created in the same voltage level. This option is used to debug the conversion and facilitate the comparison of the topology present in the CGMES input files and the topology computed by PowSyBl. The attributes of the busbar section are created as such:
- Identity attributes `Id` and `Name` are copied from the `ConnectivityNode`.
- `Node` The same `Node` assigned to the mapped `ConnectivityNode`.

(cgmes-topological-node-import)=
### TopologicalNode

If the CGMES model is defined at bus/branch detail, then `TopologicalNode` objects are used in the conversion, and for each of them a `Bus` is created in the PowSyBl grid model inside the corresponding voltage level container, at the PowSyBl bus/breaker topology level. The created `Bus` has the following attributes:
- Identity attributes `Id` and `Name` are copied from the `TopologicalNode`.
- `V` The voltage of the `TopologicalNode` is copied if it is valid (greater than `0`).
- `Angle` The angle the `TopologicalNode` is copied if the previous voltage is valid.

(cgmes-busbar-section-import)=
### BusbarSection

Busbar sections can be created in PowSyBl grid model only at node/breaker level.

CGMES Busbar sections are mapped to PowSyBl busbar sections only if CGMES is node/breaker and the import option `iidm.import.cgmes.create-busbar-section-for-every-connectivity-node` is set to `false`. In this case, a `BusbarSection` is created in the PowSyBl grid model for each `BusbarSection` of the CGMES model, with the attributes created as such:
- Identity attributes `Id` and `Name` are copied from the CGMES `BusbarSection`.
- `Node` A new `Node` in the corresponding voltage level.

(cgmes-energy-consumer-import)=
### EnergyConsumer

Every `EnergyConsumer` in the CGMES model creates a new `Load` in PowSyBl. The attributes are created as such:
- `P0`, `Q0` are set from CGMES values taken from `SSH`, `SV`, or `EQ` data depending on which are defined.
- `LoadType` It will be `FICTITIOUS` if the `Id` of the `energyConsumer` contains the pattern `fict`. Otherwise `UNDEFINED`.
- `LoadDetail` Additional information about conform and non-conform loads is added as an extension of the `Load` object (for more details about the [extension](../../grid_model/extensions.md#load-detail)).

The `LoadDetail` extension attributes depend on the `type` property of the `EnergyConsumer`. For a conform load:
- `withFixedActivePower` is always `0`.
- `withFixedReactivePower` is always `0`.
- `withVariableActivePower` is set to the Load `P0`.
- `withVariableReactivePower` is set to the Load `Q0`.

When the type is a non-conform load:
- `withFixedActivePower` is set to the Load `P0`.
- `withFixedReactivePower` is set to the Load `Q0`.
- `withVariableActivePower` is set to `0`.
- `withVariableReactivePower` is set to `0`.

(cgmes-energy-source-import)=
### EnergySource

An `EnergySource` is a generic equivalent for an energy supplier, with the injection given using load sign convention.

For each `EnergySource` object in the CGMES model a new PowSyBl `Load` is created, with attributes created as such:
- `P0`, `Q0` set from `SSH` or `SV` values depending on which are defined.
- `LoadType` It will be `FICTITIOUS` if the `Id` of the `energySource` contains the pattern `fict`. Otherwise `UNDEFINED`.

(cgmes-sv-injection-import)=
### SvInjection

CGMES uses `SvInjection` objects to report mismatches on calculated buses: they record the calculated bus injection minus the sum of the terminal flows. According to the documentation, the values will thus follow generator sign convention: positive sign means injection into the bus. Note that all the reference cases used for development follow load sign convention to report these mismatches, so we have decided to follow this load sign convention as a first approach.

For each `SvInjection` in the CGMES network model a new PowSyBl `Load` with attributes created as such:
- `P0`, `Q0` are set from `SvInjection.pInjection/qInjection`.
- `LoadType` is always set to `FICTITIOUS`.
- `Fictitious` is set to `true`.

(cgmes-equivalent-injection-import)=
### EquivalentInjection

The mapping of an `EquivalentInjection` depends on its location relative to the boundary area.

If the `EquivalentInjection` is outside the boundary area, it will be mapped to a PowSyBl `Generator`.

If the `EquivalentInjection` is at the boundary area, its regulating voltage data will be mapped to the generation data inside the PowSyBl `DanglingLine` created at the boundary point and its values for `P`, `Q` will be used to define the DanglingLine `P0`, `Q0`. Please note that the said `DanglingLine` can be created from an [`ACLineSegment`](#aclinesegment), a [`Switch`](#switch-switch-breaker-disconnector-loadbreakswitch-protectedswitch-grounddisconnector),
an [`EquivalentBranch`](#equivalentbranch) or a [`PowerTransformer`](#powertransformer).

Attributes of the PowSyBl generator or of the PowSyBl dangling line generation are created as such:
- `MinP`/`MaxP` are copied from CGMES `minP`/`maxP` if defined, otherwise they are set to `-Double.MAX_VALUE`/`Double.MAX_VALUE`.
- `TargetP`/`TargetQ` are set from `SSH` or `SV` values depending on which are defined. CGMES values for `p`/`q` are given with load sign convention, so a change in sign is applied when copying them to `TargetP`/`TargetQ`.
- `TargetV` The `regulationTarget` property is copied if it is not equal to zero. Otherwise, the nominal voltage associated to the connected terminal of the `equivalentInjection` is assigned. For CGMES Equivalent Injections, the voltage regulation is allowed only at the point of connection.
- `VoltageRegulatorOn` It is assigned to `true` if both properties, `regulationCapability` and `regulationStatus` are `true` and the terminal is connected.
- `EnergySource` is set to `OTHER`.

### PowerTransformer

Power transformers represent electrical devices consisting of two or more coupled windings, each represented by a `PowerTransformerEnd`. PowSyBl only supports `PowerTransformers` with two or three windings.

#### PowerTransformer with two PowerTransformerEnds

If a `PowerTransformer` has two `PowerTransformerEnds`, both outside the boundary area, it is mapped to a PowSyBl [`TwoWindingsTransformer`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#two-winding-transformer).
Please note that in this case, if `PowerTransformerEnds` are in different substations, the substations are merged into one.

If a `PowerTransformer` has two `PowerTransformerEnds`, both completely inside the boundary area, and if the boundary area is not imported, the `PowerTransformer` is ignored. Otherwise, it is mapped to a PowSyBl [`TwoWindingsTransformer`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#two-winding-transformer).

If the `PowerTransformer` has one `PowerTransformerEnd` inside the boundary area and the other outside the boundary area, the importer checks if another branch is connected to the same [`TopologicalNode`](#topologicalnode) in the boundary area.
- If there is no other connected to this `TopologicalNode`, it is mapped to a PowSyBl [`DanglingLine`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line).

  - If there are only two branches with their boundary terminal connected and in different `SubGeographicalRegion`, they will both be mapped to PowSyBl [`DanglingLines`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line), which are part of the same PowSyBl [`TieLine`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#tie-line) and all other `EquivalentBranches` will be mapped to PowSyBl [`DanglingLines`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line).
  - Otherwise, they will all be mapped to PowSyBl [`DanglingLines`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line).

In every case, a `PowerTransformer` with two `PowerTransformerEnds` is mapped to an intermediary model that corresponds to a PowSyBl [`TwoWindingsTransformer`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#two-winding-transformer).

If the `PowerTransformer` is finally mapped to a PowSyBl [`DanglingLine`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line), its structural attributes (`R`, `X`, `G` and `B`) are calculated from the intermediary model's attributes, and the ratio from its ratio tap changer and/or its phase tap changer.
`P0` and `Q0` are set from CGMES `P` and `Q` values at boundary side; `PairingKey` is copied from the name of the `TopologicalNode` or the `ConnectivityNode` (respectively in `NODE-BREAKER` or `BUS-BRANCH`) inside boundaries.

If the `PowerTransformer` is finally mapped to a PowSyBl [`DanglingLine`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line), its attributes are calculated using a standard $$\pi$$ model with distributed parameters.

#### PowerTransformer with three PowerTransformerEnds

A `PowerTransformer` with three `PowerTransformerEnds` is mapped to a PowSyBl [`ThreeWindingsTransformer`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#three-winding-transformer).

If a `SeriesCompensator` has both its ends inside the same voltage level, it is mapped to a PowSyBl [`Switch`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#breakerswitch). In this case,
all its CGMES electrical attributes are ignored. It is considered as closed, fictitious and, if it is in a node-breaker voltage level, retained. Its `SwitchKind` is `BREAKER`.

If a `SeriesCompensator` has its ends inside different voltage levels, it is mapped to a PowSyBl [`Line`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#line) with attributes as described below:
- `R` is copied from CGMES `r`
- `X` is copied from CGMES `x`
- `G1`, `G2`, `B1` and `B2` are set to `0`

(cgmes-static-var-compensator-import)=
### StaticVarCompensator

Static VAR compensators represent a facility for providing variable and controllable shunt reactive power.

A `StaticVarCompensator` is mapped to a PowSyBl [`StaticVarCompensator`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#static-var-compensator) with attributes as described below:
- `Bmin` is calculated from CGMES `inductiveRating`: if it is defined and not equals to `0`, `Bmin` is `1 / inductiveRating`. Else, it is `-Double.MAX_VALUE`.
- `Bmax` is calculated from CGMES `capacitiveRating`: if it defined and not equals to `0`, `Bmax` is `1 / capacitiveRating`. Else, it is `Double.MAX_VALUE`.

A PowSyBl [`VoltagePerReactivePowerControl`](../../grid_model/extensions.md#voltage-per-reactive-power-control) extension is also created from the CGMES `StaticVarCompensator` and linked to the PowSyBl `StaticVarCompensator` with its `slope` attribute copied from CGMES `slope` if the latter is `0` or positive.

(cgmes-switch-import)=
### Switch (Switch, Breaker, Disconnector, LoadBreakSwitch, ProtectedSwitch, GroundDisconnector)

Switches, breakers, disconnectors, load break switches, protected switches and ground disconnectors are
all imported in the same manner. For convenience purposes, we will now use `Switch` as a say but keep in mind that this section is valid for all these CGMES classes.

If the `Switch` has its ends both inside the same voltage level, it is mapped to a PowSyBl [`Switch`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#breakerswitch) with attributes as described below:
- `SwitchKind` is defined depending on the CGMES class
  - If it is a CGMES `Breaker`, it is `BREAKER`
  - If it is a CGMES `Disconnector`, it is `DISCONNECTOR`
  - If it is a CGMES `LoadBreakSwitch`, it is `LOAD_BREAK_SWITCH`
  - Otherwise, it is `BREAKER`
- `Retained` is copied from CGMES `retained` if defined in node-breaker. Else, it is `false`.
- `Open` is copied from CGMES SSH `open` if defined. Else, it is copied from CGMES `normalOpen`. If neither are defined, it is `false`.

If the CGMES `Switch` has its ends in different voltage levels inside the same IGM, it is mapped to a [`Switch`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#breakerswitch) but the voltage levels, and potentially the substations, that contain its ends are merged: they are mapped to only one voltage level and/or substation.
The created PowSyBl `Switch` has its attributes defined as described above.

If the `Switch` has one side inside the boundary area and the other side outside the boundary area, the importer checks if another branch is connected to the same CGMES [`TopologicalNode`](#topologicalnode) in the boundary area.
- If there is no other branch connected to this `TopologicalNode`, it will be mapped to a PowSyBl [`DanglingLine`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line).
- If there are one or more other branches connected to this `TopologicalNode` and they all are in the same `SubGeographicalRegion`, they will all be mapped to PowSyBl [`DanglingLines`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line).
- If there is exactly one other branch connected to this `TopologicalNode` in another `SubGeographicalRegion`, they will both be mapped to PowSyBl [`DanglingLines`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line), which are part of the same PowSyBl [`TieLine`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#tie-line).
- If there are two or more other branches connected to this `TopologicalNode` in different `SubGeographicalRegions`:
  - If there are only two branches with their boundary terminal connected and in different `SubGeographicalRegion`, they will both mapped to PowSyBl [`DanglingLines`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line), which are part of the same PowSyBl [`TieLine`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#tie-line) and all other `EquivalentBranches` will be mapped to PowSyBl [`DanglingLines`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line).
  - Otherwise, they will all be mapped to PowSyBl [`DanglingLines`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line).

If the CGMES `Switch` is mapped to a PowSyBl [`DanglingLine`](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#dangling-line), its attributes are as described below:
- `R`, `X`, `G`, `B` are `0.0`;
- `PairingKey` is copied from the name of the `TopologicalNode` or the `ConnectivityNode` (respectively in `NODE-BREAKER` or `BUS-BRANCH`) inside boundaries;
- `P0` is copied from CGMES `P` of the terminal at boundary side;
- `Q0` is copied from CGMES `Q` of the terminal at boundary side

## Extensions

The CIM-CGMES format contains more information than what the `iidm` grid model needs for calculation. The additional data that are needed to export a network in CIM-CGMES format are stored in several extensions.

## Options

These properties can be defined in the configuration file in the [import-export-parameters-default-value](../../user/configuration/import-export-parameters-default-value.md) module.


**iidm.import.cgmes.boundary-location**  
Optional property that defines the directory path where the CGMES importer can find the boundary files (`EQBD` and `TPBD` profiles) if they are not present in the imported zip file. By default, its value is `<ITOOLS_CONFIG_DIR>/CGMES/boundary`.
This property can also be used at CGMES export if the network was not imported from a CGMES to indicate the boundary files that should be used for reference.

**iidm.import.cgmes.convert-boundary**  
Optional property that defines if the equipment located inside the boundary is imported as part of the network. Used for debugging purposes. `false` by default.

**iidm.import.cgmes.convert-sv-injections**  
Optional property that defines if `SvInjection` objects are converted to IIDM loads. `true` by default.

**iidm.import.cgmes.create-active-power-control-extension**
Optional property that defines if active power control extensions are created for the converted generators. `true` by default. If `true`, the extension will be created for the CGMES `SynchronousMachines` with the attribute `normalPF` defined. For these generators, the `normalPF` value will be saved as the `participationFactor` and the flag `participate` set to `true`.

**iidm.import.cgmes.create-busbar-section-for-every-connectivity-node**  
Optional property that defines if the CGMES importer creates an [IIDM Busbar Section](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#busbar-section) for each CGMES connectivity node. Used for debugging purposes. `false` by default.

**iidm.import.cgmes.create-fictitious-switches-for-disconnected-terminals-mode**  
Optional property that defines if fictitious switches are created when terminals are disconnected in CGMES node-breaker networks.
Three modes are available:
- `ALWAYS`: fictitious switches are created at every disconnected terminal.
- `ALWAYS_EXCEPT_SWITCHES`: fictitious switches are created at every disconnected terminal that is not a terminal of a switch.
- `NEVER`: no fictitious switches are created at disconnected terminals.

The default value is `ALWAYS`.

**iidm.import.cgmes.decode-escaped-identifiers**  
Optional property that defines if identifiers containing escaped characters are decoded when CGMES files are read. `true` by default.

**iidm.import.cgmes.ensure-id-alias-unicity**  
Optional property that defines if IDs' and aliases' unicity is ensured during CGMES import. If it is set to `true`, identical CGMES IDs will be modified to be unique. If it is set to `false`, identical CGMES IDs will throw an exception. `false` by default.

**iidm.import.cgmes.import-control-areas**  
Optional property that defines if control areas must be imported or not. `true` by default.

**iidm.import.cgmes.naming-strategy**  
Optional property that defines which naming strategy is used to transform CGMES identifiers to IIDM identifiers. Currently, all naming strategies assign CGMES Ids directly to IIDM Ids during import, without any transformation. The default value is `identity`.

**iidm.import.cgmes.post-processors**  
Optional property that defines all the CGMES post-processors which will be activated after import.
By default, it is an empty list.
One implementation of such a post-processor is available in PowSyBl in the [powsybl-diagram](../../developer/repositories/powsybl-diagram.md) repository, named [CgmesDLImportPostProcessor](./post_processor.md#cgmesdlimportpostprocessor).

**iidm.import.cgmes.powsybl-triplestore**  
Optional property that defines which Triplestore implementation is used. Currently, PowSyBl only supports [RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/). `rdf4j` by default.

**iidm.import.cgmes.profile-for-initial-values-shunt-sections-tap-positions**  
Optional property that defines which CGMES profile is used to initialize tap positions and section counts. It can be `SSH` or `SV`. The default value is `SSH`.

**iidm.import.cgmes.source-for-iidm-id**  
Optional property that defines if IIDM IDs must be obtained from the CGMES `mRID` (master resource identifier) or the CGMES `rdfID` (Resource Description Framework identifier). The default value is `mRID`.

**iidm.import.cgmes.store-cgmes-model-as-network-extension**    
Optional property that defines if the whole CGMES model is stored in the imported IIDM network as an [extension](import.md#cgmes-model). The default value is `true`.

**iidm.import.cgmes.store-cgmes-conversion-context-as-network-extension**  
Optional property that defines if the CGMES conversion context is stored as an extension of the IIDM output network. It is useful for external validation of the mapping made between CGMES and IIDM. Its default value is `false`.

**iidm.import.cgmes.import-node-breaker-as-bus-breaker**  
Optional property that forces CGMES model to be in topology bus/breaker in IIDM. This is a key feature when some models do not have all the breakers to connect and disconnect equipments in IIDM. In bus/breaker topology, connect and disconnect equipment only rely on terminal statuses and not on breakers. Its default value is `false`.

**iidm.import.cgmes.disconnect-dangling-line-if-boundary-side-is-disconnected**  
Optional property used at CGMES import that disconnects the IIDM dangling line if in the CGMES model the line is open at the boundary side. As IIDM does not have any equivalence for that, this is an approximation. Its default value is `false`.

**iidm.import.cgmes.missing-permanent-limit-percentage**  
Optional property used when in operational limits, temporary limits are present and the permanent limit is missing as it is forbidden in IIDM. The missing permanent limit is equal to a percentage of the lowest temporary limit, with the percentage defined by the value of this property if present, `100` by default.

**iidm.import.cgmes.cgm-with-subnetworks**  
Optional property to define if subnetworks must be added to the network when importing a Common Grid Model (CGM). Each subnetwork will model an Individual Grid Model (IGM). By default `true`: subnetworks are added, and the merging is done at IIDM level, with a main IIDM network representing the CGM and containing a set of subnetworks, one for each IGM. If the value is set to `false` all the CGMES data will be flattened in a single network and information about the ownership of each equipment will be lost.

**iidm.import.cgmes.cgm-with-subnetworks-defined**  
If `iidm.import.cgmes.cgm-with-subnetworks` is set to `true`, use this property to specify how the set of input files should be split by IGM: based on their filenames (use the value `FILENAME`) or by its modeling authority, read from the header (use the value `MODELING_AUTHORITY`).
