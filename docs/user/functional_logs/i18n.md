# Internationalization

The internationalization of the functional logs is currently under development.

Nonetheless, note that currently, it is possible to insert one or several dictionaries to the JSON file resulting from the report node serialization.
Indeed, the JSON format expects a list of dictionaries, and the import allows to choose one dictionary among the provided list (see [import](../../user/configuration/import-export-parameters-default-value.md#import-export-parameters-default-value)).
