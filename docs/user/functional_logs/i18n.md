# Internationalization

It is possible to insert one or several dictionaries to the JSON file resulting from the report node serialization.
Indeed, the JSON format expects a list of dictionaries, and the import allows to choose one dictionary among the provided list (see [import](../../user/configuration/import-export-parameters-default-value.md#import-export-parameters-default-value)).

[ResourceBundle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html) is used to handle the `ReportNode` messages internationalization. It enables to load locale translation from properties files containing locale-specific data (dictionary with `key = value`).

For ReportNode defined in Powsybl-Core, the resource bundle is located in the `commons` module and is named `reports`.

The default translation for any translation key must be present in the `reports.properties` file.

A locale dictionary is represented by a `reports_<locale>.properties` file in the bundle with the locale as suffix. For instance: for the locale `en_US` the dictionary is in the `reports_en_US.properties`.

If a translation key is not present in a locale dictionary the mechanism is to fall back to a more general dictionary and if there is still no match the ultimate fallback is on the default dictionary.
