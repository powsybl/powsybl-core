# Import

The report node JSON file obtained from `ReportNode` serialization can be deserialized
- from a file `Path`
```java
ReportNode.read(path);
```
- from an `InputStream`
```java
ReportNode.read(inputStream);
```

## Version
Currently, the only serialized version supported is the version 2.1.

## Dictionaries
The two methods above look for a `default` dictionary in the `dictionaries` list.
If no `default` dictionary is found, the first entry of the list is taken.

If several dictionaries are defined in the JSON file, we can choose which dictionary has to be used for deserialization by providing the dictionary name:
```java
ReportNode.read(path, dictionary);
ReportNode.read(inputStream, dictionary);
```
Similarly, if the chosen dictionary cannot be found, the first entry of the list is taken.
