# Network modifications

The `powsybl-iidm-modification` module gathers classes and methods used to modify the network easily.  
Each modification must first be created with the right attributes or parameters and then applied on the network.  
A `NetworkModification` offers a method to check whether or not its application would have an impact on the given network.

## Other modifications

### List
This modification is used to apply a list of any Powsybl `NetworkModification`.

Class: `NetworkModificationList`

### Area interchange
This modification is used to update the target of an area interchange.

The target is in MW in load sign convention (negative for export, positive for import).  
Providing `Double.NaN` removes the target.

Class: `AreaInterchangeTargetModification`

### Battery
This modification is used to update the target powers (active `targetP` and reactive `targetV`) of a battery.

Class: `BatteryModification`

### Connection
This modification is used to connect a network element to the closest bus or bus bar section.

It works on:
- `Connectable` elements by connecting their terminals
- HVDC lines, by connecting the terminals of their converter stations
- Tie lines, by connecting the terminals of their underlying dangling lines

It is possible to specify a side of the element to connect. If no side is specified, the network modification will try to connect every side.

Class: `ConnectableConnection`

### Dangling line
This modification is used to update the active and reactive powers of a dangling line.

If `relativeValue` is set to true, then the new constant active power (`P0`) and reactive power (`Q0`) are set as the addition of the given values to the previous ones.  
If `relativeValue` is set to false, then the new constant active power (`P0`) and reactive power (`Q0`) are updated to the new given values.

Class: `DanglingLineModification`

### Disconnections

#### Planned
This modification is used to disconnect a network element from the bus or bus bar section to which it is currently connected. It should be used if the disconnection is planned. If it is not,
`UnplannedDisconnection` should be used instead.

It works on:
- `Connectable` elements.
- HVDC lines, by disconnecting their converter stations
- Tie lines, by disconnecting their underlying dangling lines

It is possible to specify a side of the element to connect. If no side is specified, the network modification will try to connect every side.

Class: `PlannedDisconnection`

#### Unplanned
This modification is used to disconnect a network element from the bus or bus bar section to which it is currently connected. It should be used if the disconnection is unplanned. If it is not,
`PlannedDisconnection` should be used instead.

It works on:
- `Connectable` elements.
- HVDC lines, by disconnecting their converter stations
- Tie lines, by disconnecting their underlying dangling lines

It is possible to specify a side of the element to connect. If no side is specified, the network modification will try to connect every side.

Class: `UnplannedDisconnection`

### Generator

#### Modification
This modification is used to apply a set of modifications on a generator.

The data to be updated are optional among:
- `minP`, the minimum active power boundary in MW.
- `maxP`, the maximum active power boundary in MW.
- `targetV`, the target voltage value in kV.
- `targetQ`, the target reactive power value in MVAR.
- `connected`, the connection state of the generator terminal.
- `voltageRegulatorOn`, to activate or deactivate the generator voltage regulator status. If `true` and the generator target voltage is not set then an acceptable value for the generator `targetV` is computed before activating.
- The active power if `targetP` or `deltaTargetP` are given. An active power is determined by the new `targetP` if given, and if not then the `deltaTargetP` is considered instead and the new value of the generator `targetP` is the addition of the old generator value with the given delta target P value. Then, according to the given `ignoreCorrectiveOperations` parameter:
  - If `ignoreCorrectiveOperations` is true, this determined active power is applied as the new generator target P value.
  - If `ignoreCorrectiveOperations` is false, then the new active power will also depend on the limits and will be the minimum value between the generator `maxP` and the maximum value between the generator `minP` and the previously determined active power value. Besides, if the generator connection state has not been updated before within this `NetworkModification` then the generator is connected if necessary.

Class: `GeneratorModification`

#### Connection
This modification is used to connect a given generator.

If the generator terminal is regulating then it will also set its target voltage if an acceptable value is found.

Class: `ConnectGenerator`

#### Set to local regulation
This modification is used to set the generator regulating terminal to a local regulation.

The target voltage value is set to the same value for all the generators of the bus that are regulating locally.
In case other generators are already regulating locally on the same bus, targetV value is determined by being the closest value to the voltage level nominal voltage among the regulating terminals.
If no other generator is regulating on the same bus, targetV engineering unit value is adapted to the voltage level nominal voltage, but the per unit value remains the same.

Class:`SetGeneratorToLocalRegulation`

### HVDC line
This modification is used to modify a given HVDC line (and potentially its angle droop active power control extension).

- Modify the HVDC line `activePowerSetpoint` if given, relatively to the existent `activePowerSetpoint` if `relativeValue` is true or as a replacement value if not.
- Modify the `convertersMode` with the given one if set
- Modify the angle droop active power control extension (if existing but will not crash if not found for the HVDC line):
  - Enable or disable the AC emulation if `acEmulationEnabled` is provided
  - Update the active power if `p0` is provided
  - Update the droop in MW/degree if `droop` is provided

Class: `HvdcLineModification`

### Load

#### Modification
This modification updates the `P` and `Q` values of the load.

If `relativeValue` is set to true, then the new constant active power (`P0`) and reactive power (`Q0`) are set as the addition of the given values to the previous ones.  
If `relativeValue` is set to false, then the new constant active power (`P0`) and reactive power (`Q0`) are updated to the new given values.

Class: `LoadModification`

#### Percent modification

A phase shifter optimization load flow is run with the configured `load-flow-based-phase-shifter-optimizer` to determine the optimal tap position.

Class: `PhaseShifterOptimizeTap`

#### Fixed tap modification
This modification updates the phase tap changer of a given two-winding transformer phase shifter id.

It updates its `tapPosition` with the given value and set the phase tap changer as not regulating with a `FIXED_TAP` regulation mode.

Class: `PhaseShifterSetAsFixedTap`

#### Shift tap modification
This modification is used to update the phase tap changer of a given two-winding transformer phase shifter id.

It sets the phase tap changer as not regulating with a `FIXED_TAP` regulation mode and updates its `tapPosition` by adjusting it with the given `tapDelta` applied on the current tap position. The resulting tap position is bounded by the phase tap changer lowest and highest possible positions.

Class: `PhaseShifterShiftTap`

### Replace tie lines by lines
This modification is used to replace all the tie lines of a network to simple lines built from the original tie line and its 2 dangline lines.

- For each voltage level the topology kind is taken into account to create node (for `NODE_BREAKER` kind) or bus and connectable bus (for `BUS_BREAKER` kind)
- The tie line id, name, r, x, b1, b2, g1, g2 are set in the new line
- Active power limits, apparent power limits and current limits are set on each side of the line from the limits of the 2 dangling lines
- Terminal active and reactive powers are set for both terminals from each dangling line active and reactive powers
- Line properties are set from the merge of the tie line and its 2 dangling lines properties
- Line aliases are set from the merge of the tie line and its 2 dangling lines aliases
