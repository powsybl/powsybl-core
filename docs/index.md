# PowSyBl Core

PowSyBl (<b>Pow</b>er <b>Sy</b>stem <b>Bl</b>ocks) is an open source framework written in Java,
dedicated to electrical grid modelling and simulation, licensed under the [Mozilla Public License version 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).
It is part of [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/), an open source foundation focused on the power systems sector, hosted within The Linux Foundation.

PowSyBl may be used through Python scripts for a quick implementation (or prototyping), but also 
be assembled to build applications.

Check the [Getting started](../documentation/user) and [Configuration](../documentation/user/configuration) pages to learn how to install and configure PowSyBl.
