# Inputs

The API takes as inputs:

**A network**

It is the network on which the computation will be done.

**A list of faults**

The API takes as input a list of faults on which the calculation should be done. Faults on buses and on lines are supported.
Each fault can either be an instance of `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.BusFault` or `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.BranchFault`.

The attributes to fill of a `BusFault` are:

| Attribute  | Type           | Unit | Required | Default value           | Description                                                                                             |

**A list of FaultParameters**

Optionally, it is possible to specify a list of `FaultParameters`. Each `FaultParameter` will override the default parameters for a given fault.
For more information on parameters, see [above](#faultparameters).
