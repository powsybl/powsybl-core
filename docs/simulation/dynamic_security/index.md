# Dynamic security analysis

```{toctree}

The dynamic security analysis is a [security analysis](../security/index.md) using dynamic models associated with static equipments of the network.

## Inputs

### Dynamic models mapping
The dynamic models mapping is exactly the same [mapping](../dynamic/index.md#dynamic-models-mapping) used for a dynamic simulation.

### Others inputs
Beside dynamic models mapping, the dynamic security analysis requires the same [inputs as the standard one](../security/index.md#inputs).

## Outputs
The dynamic security analysis produces the same outputs as the standard one. All outputs can be found [here](../security/index.md#outputs).

## Implementations
For the moment, the only available implementation is provided by powsybl-dynawo, which links PowSyBl with [DynaÏ‰o](http://dynawo.org) open source suite.
