The security analysis is a simulation that check violations on a network. These checks can be done on the base case or after a contingency, with or without remedial actions. A security analysis can monitor network states, in pre-contingency state, after a contingency and after a remedial action.

There is a violation if the computed value is greater than the maximum allowed value. Depending on the equipments, the violations can have different types:
- Current, active power and apparent power: this kind of violations can be detected on a branch (line, two windings transformer, tie line) or on a three windings transformer, if the computed value is greater than its [permanent limit](../../grid_model/additional.md#loading-limits) or one of its [temporary limits](../../grid_model/additional.md#loading-limits).
- Voltage: this kind of violations can be detected on a bus or a bus bar section, if the computed voltage is out of the low-high voltage limits of a [voltage level](../../grid_model/network_subnetwork.md#voltage-level).
- Voltage angle: this kind of violations can be detected if the voltage angle difference between the buses associated to two terminals is out of the low-high voltage angle limits defined in the network.

## Inputs

### Network
The first input of the security analysis is a network. As this simulation is based on a [load flow](../loadflow/index) engine for a list of contingencies, this network should converge in the pre-contingency state.

### Contingencies
The security analysis needs a list of contingencies as an input. When contingencies are provided, the violations are detected on the network at pre-contingency state, but also after applying each contingency. The supported elementary contingencies are:
- Generator contingency
- Static var compensator contingency
- Load contingency
- Bus contingency for bus/breaker topologies
- Busbar section contingency for node/breaker topologies
- Line, two-winding transformer and tie line contingencies (branch contingency)
- Three-winding transformer contingency
- HVDC line contingency

A contingency is made of contingency elements. A contingency can trigger one element at a time (N-1) or several elements at a time (N-K). Bus bar and bus contingencies are special N-K contingencies as they trigger all the equipments connected to a given bus bar section.

### Remedial actions
Remedial actions are actions that are applied when limit violations occur. Supported actions are:
- Open or close a switch
- Open or close a terminal
- Change the tap of a tap changer (phase or ratio)
- Change the active and/or reactive power of a load
- Change the section of a shunt compensator
- Change the regulation status of a tap changer
- Change `targetP`, `targetQ`, regulation status and `targetV` of a generator
- Change the regulation mode of a static var compensator and its associated set point.
- Enabled or disabled AC emulation for HVDC line (with the possibility to change `P0` and `droop` for AC emulation and active power set point and converter mode for set point operating mode)

Remedial actions can be *preventive* or *curative*:
- preventive: these actions are implemented before the violation occurs, for example if the flow of a monitored line is between `90%` and `100%`. Use contingency context `NONE` for that.
- curative: these actions are implemented after a violation occurs, for example if the flow of the monitored line is greater than `100%`.

### Conditions
Actions are applied if a condition is met. The conditions can be diversified and extended in the future:
- True condition: meaning that the list of actions is applied.
- All violations condition on a list of elements: meaning that the list of actions is applied only if all elements provided are overloaded.
- At least one violation condition: meaning that the list of actions is applied only if a violation occurs on the network.
- Any violation condition on a list of elements: meaning that the list of actions is applied if one or more elements provided are overloaded.

### Operator strategies
An operator strategy is applied in pre-contingency or after a contingency, depending on the contingency context provided. A contingency context can be a pre-contingency state only (`NONE`), a post-contingency state (on a specific contingency (`SPECIFIC`) or on every contingency (`ONLY_CONTINGENCIES`)) or both pre-contingency and post-contingency states (`ALL`).

An operator strategy groups a condition and a list of remedial actions.

### State monitors
A stateMonitor allows to get information about branch, bus and three-winding transformers on the network after a security analysis computation. Contingency context allows to specify if the information asked are about pre-contingency state or post-contingency state with a contingency id or both. For example:
- If we want information about a branch after security analysis on contingency `c1`, the contingencyContext will contain the contingencyId `c1`, contextType `SPECIFIC` and the state monitor will contain the id of the branch.
- If we want information about a branch in pre-contingency state, the contingencyContext will contain a null contingencyId, contextType `NONE` and the state monitor will contain the id of the branch.
- If we want information about a branch in pre-contingency state and after security analysis on contingency `c1`, the contingencyContext will contain contingencyId `c1`, contextType `ALL` and the state monitor will contain the id of the branch.

## Outputs

### Pre-contingency results
The violations are detected on the network at state N, meaning before a contingency occurred. This determines a reference for the simulation. For each violation, we get the ID of the overloaded equipment, the limit type (`CURRENT`, `ACTIVE_POWER`, `APPARENT_POWER`, `LOW_VOLTAGE` or `HIGH_VOLTAGE`, `LOW_VOLTAGE_ANGLE` or `HIGH_VOLTAGE_ANGLE`), the acceptable value and the computed value. For branches and three windings transformers, we also have the side where the violation has been detected.

The pre-contingency results also contain the network results based on given state monitors. A network result groups branch results, bus results and three-winding transformer results. All elementary results are fully extendable.

### Post-contingency results
The post-contingency results contain the complete list of the contingencies that have been simulated, and for each of them the violations detected. To limit information to the user, only new violations or worsened violations can be listed.

The post-contingency results also contain the network results based on given state monitors.

### Operator strategy results
The post-contingency results contain the complete list of the contingencies that have been simulated, and for each of them the violations detected in order to check if remedial actions were efficient.

The operator strategy results also contain the network results based on given state monitors.

### Extensions
The results of a security analysis are extendable, meaning you can have additional information attached to the network, the contingencies or the violations.
