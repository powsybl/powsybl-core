/**
 *
 * Computation managers have the ability to execute commands provided through an {@link ExecutionHandler}.
 *
 * <p>Typically, they are used to execute expensive computations through external processes.
 * According to the computation manager implementation, those processes may then be executed on the local host
 * or on a dedicated computation infrastructure which may have better performance or scaling capabilities.
 * Commands will be executed asynchronously and results accessible through the {@link CompletableFuture}
 * returned by one of the {@link #execute} method variants. If {@link CompletableFuture#cancel} is called,
 * the computation manager should try as much as possible to free computation resources used for the
 * underlying commands execution.
 *
 * <p>The computation manager must provide a temporary working directory for each submitted execution,
 * where data may be written to (in particular before the execution) and read from (in particular after the execution).
 * A prefix for this directory may be provided through the {@link ExecutionEnvironment}.
 * Typically, the prefix will be appended with a UUID to ensure working directory uniqueness.
 * If {@link ExecutionEnvironment#isDebug()} is {@literal true}, that working directory will not be discarded,
 * otherwise it may be discarded to ensure a sustainable use of the execution environment.
 *
 * <p>Execution handlers define a list of {@link CommandExecution}s to be executed.
 * Those command executions must be executed sequentially. However, when a command execution
 * has an execution number greater than one, the corresponding executions may be executed in parallel.
 *
 * <p>The interface extends {@link AutoCloseable}, since it may require some resource cleanup on closing,
 * for instance deleting working directories or closing connections to remote infrastructure.
