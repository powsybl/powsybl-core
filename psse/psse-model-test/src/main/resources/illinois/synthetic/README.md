# Synthetic Power Grid Test Cases

Synthetic power grid models are a large-scale representation of power grids with a detailed modeling of the power system dynamics and protections. They use statistical metrics to mimic the complexity of the real grid but without any confidential data. Researchers can freely use synthetic power grid to test and validate new tools and techniques as on actual power grid. This work is supported by [ARPA-E’s GRID DATA program](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=news-item/doe-announces-11-million-seven-new-projects-test-new-options-optimal-efficiency-us).
