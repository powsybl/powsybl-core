/**
 * This enum represents the potential impact of a network modification on a network.
 * <p>
 *     The possible values for the enum are:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>{@code CANNOT_BE_APPLIED}: the network modification cannot be applied on this network. If it applied,
 *         an exception will be thrown.</li>
 *         <li>{@code NO_IMPACT_ON_NETWORK}: the network modification can be applied to the network but, once the
 *         network modification is applied, the network will still be the same as before.</li>
 *         <li>{@code HAS_IMPACT_ON_NETWORK}: the network modification can be applied to the network and, once the
 *         network modification is applied, the network will be different in its topology, steady states hypothesis
 *         or physical characteristics.</li>
