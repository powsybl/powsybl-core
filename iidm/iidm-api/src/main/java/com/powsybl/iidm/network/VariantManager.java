 * WARNING: Variant management is not thread safe and should never be done will an other thread read from or write to
 * an already existing variant. The classical pattern for multi-variant processing is to pre-allocate variants and
 * call {@link #allowVariantMultiThreadAccess} to allow multi-thread access on main thread, work on variants from other
 * threads (be carefull to only write concurrently attributes flagged as dependent to variant in the Javadoc) and then
 * remove variants from main thread once work is over.
