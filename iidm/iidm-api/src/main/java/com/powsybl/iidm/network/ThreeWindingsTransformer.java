/**
 * A Three Windings Power Transformer.
 * <p>
 * The equivalent star model used is: <div>
 * <object data="doc-files/threeWindingsTransformer.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
 * </object> </div>
 * <p>
 * Usually side 1 is the primary (high voltage), side 2 is the secondary (medium
 * voltage) and side 3 the tertiary voltage (low voltage).
 * <p>
 * g1, g2, g3 and b1, b2, b3 unit is siemens.
 * <p>
 * r1, r2, r3, x1, x2 and x3 unit is ohm.
 * <p>
 * A Three Windings Transformer is connected to three voltage levels (side 1, side 2 and
 * side 3) that belong to the same substation. It has three identical legs. Each leg has
 * the same model of a Two Windings Power Transformer.
 * <p>
 * All three legs may have a Ratio Tap Changer and a Phase Tap Changer.
 * A warning is emitted if a leg has both Ratio and Phase Tap Changers.
 * <p>
 * Only one Tap Changer is allowed to be regulating on the equipment. An exception is thrown if
 * two or more regulating controls are enabled.
 * <p>
 * To create a three windings transformer, see {@link ThreeWindingsTransformerAdder}
