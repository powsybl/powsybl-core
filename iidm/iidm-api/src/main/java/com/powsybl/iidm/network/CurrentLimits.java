 * Current limits are defined by:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A permanent limit (A)</li>
 *     <li>
 * Any number of temporary limits.
 * A permanent limit (A) has an acceptable duration (s).
 * The branch can safely stay between the previous limit (could be another temporary limit or the permanent limit) and
 * this limit during the acceptable duration.
 * A NaN temporay limit value means infinite.
 *     </li>
