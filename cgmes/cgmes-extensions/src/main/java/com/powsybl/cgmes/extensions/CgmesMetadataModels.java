/**
 * <p>In each CGMES instance file there is a unique <code>Model</code> object that holds metadata information.</p>
 * <p>The model contents are specified by profiles: equipment, power flow initial values, power flow results, etc.</p>
 * <p>Each model can contain data from multiple profiles and is produced by a modeling authority.</p>
 * <p>A model may have relationships to other models. Two kind of relationships are considered: "dependent on" and "supersedes".</p>
 * <p>A "dependent on" is a reference to an other required model. As an example: a load flow solution depends on the topology model it was computed from.</p>
 * <p>When a model is updated, the resulting model "supersedes" the models that were used as basis for the update.</p>
 * <p>
 * As an example: when building a Common Grid Model (CGM) from Individual Grid Models (IGM),
 * the power flow initial assumptions (SSH) of each IGM might be adjusted as part of the merging process and area interchange control,
 * thus updated SSH instance files are created.
 * Each updated SSH model "supersedes" the original one.
 * </p>
 * <p>More information can be found in the IEC-61970-552.</p>
