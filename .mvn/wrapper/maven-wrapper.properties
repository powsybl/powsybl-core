# Maven Wrapper Configuration (modern version, Maven Wrapper >= 3.3.x)
# ============================================================================

# Maven binary version to use for the project
distributionType=bin
distributionUrl=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.9.3/apache-maven-3.9.3-bin.zip

# Maven Wrapper version (JAR) used to bootstrap Maven
# wrapperUrl is optional and can be omitted; the script will construct the URL automatically
wrapperVersion=3.3.3

# ============================================================================
# Notes:
# - The Maven Wrapper (mvnw / mvnw.cmd scripts) verifies download integrity (SHA-256) internally.
# - MVNW_REPOURL is supported to redirect downloads to internal repositories (useful in CI/CD or offline setups).
# - To update the wrapper while keeping the same Maven version:
#     mvn -N wrapper:wrapper -Dmaven=3.9.3 -DwrapperVersion=3.3.3 -DdistributionType=bin
